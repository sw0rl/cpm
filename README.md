Computational Mathematics

Hi, this is where all my computational mathematics code is stored.

Pi - Java:
This program approximates pi by generating a given number points within a square with side-length (Double length) and calculating the ratio of points inside a quartercircle to outside the quartercircle then multiplying it by 4. The number of points inside is calculated by first calculating the distance of the point from the origin and incrementing the number of points inside by 1 if it is >= 10.
